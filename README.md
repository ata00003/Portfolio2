My Reflections on Website Project
---
## Introduction
I came into this class, with o no knowledge of HTML and CSS and I never imagined myself as a web designer/ developer after finishing this program. However, over the course of these two semesters, I slowly grew to have an understanding of them, and now I aim to work as a web designer. But there is still much more that I could learn.

## Portfolio Website Project Process
It was a project starting from designing the prototype in Adobe XD from scratch. Coding is a challenging but also the most satisfying part for me. When I return to coding big projects after days, I feel as if I were a person lost in an island not knowing any language. The most difficult part of project is to start and focus on the project. Later when I build up the pages, it becomes easier.

To talk about technically, I have had difficulty to make the layout look alright. I find a bit tricky to set up the margins and using grids and flexboxes. I think I will overcome this handicap practicing a lot during summer.
I learned how to make hamburger menu during this project and also used a gradient background for the first time.

## Conclusion
I can say that Iâ€™m satisfied with design but not the content of the web site. I am planning to add more content about me and my works, and I want to showcase my more professional works.
